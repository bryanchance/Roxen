• HTTP: Fixed documentation typo.

• HTTP: Changed unit in request data size limit to KB.

• HTTP: Added request data max limit.

This limit causes the http protocol layer to abort a request with
a 413 error when the peer is attempting to upload too much data.

Fixes [WS-443].

• HTTP: Increased paranoia regarding errors on close().

• HTTP: Added send_size_error().

This sends a 413 error.

Fixes some of [WS-443].

• HTTP: Make error_page() useful for more errors.

• New error code images.

• Start: Fixed signal handling issue --without-daemon.

When running --without-daemon an extra level of sub-shells
caused signals to the top-level shell to be lost.

Also adds some internal documentation.

Fixes [WS-438].
